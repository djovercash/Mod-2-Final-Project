# Task Cheetah

Become a cheetah! Task Cheetah allows users to help other cheetahs with the tasks they post for cheetah points.

The goal was to create an application using Ruby on Rails for the frontend and backend with full CRUD functionality.

In development, we integrated Google Maps to display location of individual tasks, fashioned custom CSS to design a unique and fun frontend for users to explore, and created an analytical data page for administrative users.

# Concerns and Issues 
- There is plenty of refactoring to be done in order to make clearner and clearer code.
- Would like to remake this application with a React.js frontend for a more exciting UI experience.
